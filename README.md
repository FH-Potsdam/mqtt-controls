# mqtt-controls

a wrapper for using the mqtt lib in a upcoming project.
Might be useful just for me.

## Install

npm install mqtt-controls

## Usage  

    var mq = require('mqtt-controls');
    var open = require('open'); // just to see whats going on
    
    mq.init(); // setup with defaults
    mq.connect(); // connect
    console.log('opening https://shiftr.io/try so you see whats going on');
    open('https://shiftr.io/try#terminal'); // see it online
    var count = 0; 
    // send ten pings and disconnect
    var timer = setInterval(function(){
      mq.send('ping','hello-world');
      console.log('ping');
      count++;
      if(count == 10){
        clearInterval(timer);
        mq.disconnect();
      }
    }, 1000);
